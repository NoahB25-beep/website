        <p>Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves! Britons never, never, never will be slaves. When Britain first, at heaven's command, Arose from out the azure main, This was the charter of the land, And Guardian Angels sang this strain: (Chorus) The nations not so blest as thee Must, in their turn, to tyrants fall, While thou shalt flourish great and free: The dread and envy of them all. (Chorus) Still more majestic shalt thou rise, More dreadful from each foreign stroke, As the loud blast that tears the skies Serves but to root thy native oak. (Chorus) Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame; All their attempts to bend thee down Will but arouse thy generous flame, But work their woe and thy renown. (Chorus) To thee belongs the rural reign; Thy cities shall with commerce shine; All thine shall be the subject main, And every shore it circles, thine. (Chorus) The Muses, still with freedom found, Shall to thy happy coasts repair. Blest isle! with matchless beauty crowned, And manly hearts to guard the fair. (Chorus) Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves! Britons never, never, never will be slaves. </p>

        <h1>Macbeth Essay</h1>
        <p class="italic">Suggestion from Theo</p>
        <p>
	In Act 1, 7 Shakespeare shows how Lady Macbeth is ambitious and is determined to do the
murder when Macbeth thinks about failing. One thing that shows this is ‚Äúwhen you durst do
it then you were a man‚Äù. This shows that she is trying to say he‚Äôs not a man like he used to
be, that he‚Äôs not strong enough to do the deed and doesn‚Äôt deserve to be called a ‚Äúman‚Äù.
Shakespeare also presents Lady Macbeth in this scene to be ambitious and violent when she
says ‚Äúwhile it was smiling in my face, have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums and
dash‚Äôd the brains out.‚Äù This shows that she would rather kill her baby than not go through
with the plan. In this extract Lady Macbeth seems determined and ambitious and not like
women should have been in the 1606 when the play was written.
The first key moment where we see what Lady Macbeth will be like in the rest of the play is
in Act 1, scene 5 when she gets the letter from Macbeth. The letter is very important
because it shows how passionate she is to become queen and her husband king, so then she
comes up with a plan. Shortly after that in Act 1, scene 7 (the extract) Lady Macbeth
convinces Macbeth to kill King Duncan that night. Lady Macbeth explains her plan here and
Macbeth changes his mind again. In the seventeenth century it wouldn‚Äôt be normal for a
2
woman to act like this, it would be about the man to make the plans and convince a woman
how easy it would be to do it.
The key message in this scene where Macbeth gets persuaded is when he says the four
simple words ‚ÄúIf we should fail?‚Äù to which Lady Macbeth replies ‚ÄúWe fail?‚Äù Shakespeare
uses Lady Macbeth here to show her desire for power and strongly say that it‚Äôs impossible
to fail.
In Act 1.5 when Lady Macbeth thought Macbeth wasn‚Äôt going to kill King Duncan because he
was too kind, full of ‚Äúthe milk of human kindness‚Äù, she said ‚Äúunsex me here‚Äù. This shows she
wishes she was a man so she could kill King Duncan because she feels like she could kill him
mentally just not physically.
In Act 5. 1 Lady Macbeth starts to sleep walk because she can‚Äôt deal with the fact that her
husband killed King Duncan and that it‚Äôs all her fault and she says ‚ÄúMy bloody hands‚Äù. This
shows she‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs her fault and she holds the guilt. This leads to her committing suicide
in Act 5.5.
